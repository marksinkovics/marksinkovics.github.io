I love playing with Sudoku, I love challanging myself with more and more difficult ones where I can practice my the newly learning solving techniques.
This project has started as a learning project. I always wanted to deep dive into the world of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). I believe learning a new technology is easier, simpler by practicing and using it. The whole app has been built on the top of that framework. That is how it happened that my beloved game and my goal met.

Currently the source code is private, but the aim is to make it available for everyone who is interested in the technology or in the game itself.
