I love playing with Sudoku, I love challanging myself with more and more difficult ones where I can practice my the newly learning solving techniques.
This project has started as a learning project. I always wanted to deep dive into the world of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). I believe learning a new technology is easier, simpler by practicing and using it. The whole app has been built on the top of that framework. That is how it happened that my beloved game and my goal met.

## Next steps

* Redesign the UI
* Make it available on iPad
* Add Apple Pencil support
* Localize the app
* Add timer to the game
