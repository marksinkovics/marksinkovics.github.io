Most developers, including myself, find very difficult to manage different outer dependencies of projects. Although in the market, there are plenty of solution to help us managing 3rd party packages, the most of them try to solve a specific problem such as CocoaPods which is a perfect extension for Xcode. These tools work flawlessly in that environment where they were designed. From this list only a few of them, which want to solve this problem "globally". Who knows Git Submodules, think that as an ultimate solution, but I have to admint, no. Every time, it

Most of them don't like to use Git submodules as source dependency manager because it adds extra commit to the tree by updating outer dependency

This git "extension" help the develop to manage git-dependencies without extra commit and limitations.


I work as a contributor on this project.
