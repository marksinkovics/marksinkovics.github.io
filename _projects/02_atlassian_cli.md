subtitle: "the \"missing\" command-line interface for Atlassian products :rocket:"
---
The main purpose of this project is to create a command-line interface for Atlassian products (mainly Jira, Bitbucket and Confluence) in order to make possible other scripts (bash, python, etc.) to easily communicate and modify those products.

This project is separated into 2 parts. The first is a reusable pip package which could be used other python scripts. While the second part is a the actual terminal interface.

__More information will be provided soon :construction:__
