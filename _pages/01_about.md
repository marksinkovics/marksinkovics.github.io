I consider myself a technology enthusiast, who is keen on learning new technologies, techniques, design patterns and programming languages. Fortunately, my profession is my passion and I love what I can achieve with that.

My motto is “quality over quantity”. I am obsessed with the quality in my work. However, occasionally, it has to be put aside and I have to put more emphasis on getting stuff done and improving it later.

I think of myself as good team player. I love working in a team. I have the ability to adapt quickly, work efficiently and liaise confidently as part of a team or work independently if needed.

I believe in the strength of communication in every part of my life. It tears down barriers and opens new opportunities.
