I consider myself as a technology enthusiast, who is keen on learning new techniques, 
design patterns and programming languages.  Fortunately, my work is my hobby and I love what I can achieve with it. 

My motto is “quality over quantity” so I am obsessed with the quality in my work however I can realise when it is not necessary. 


I love working in a team, I have the ability to adapt quickly, work efficiently and liaise confidently as part of a team or on my own.  

I believe in the strength of the communication in every part of my life. It tears down barriers and opens new opportunities.
